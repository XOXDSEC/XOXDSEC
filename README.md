# Enzo Marins

I'm a cybersecurity student @ FIAP in São Paulo. My work and learning are centered on understanding how systems fail — and how to build, monitor, and defend them with purpose and precision.

I believe that cybersecurity is about developing a clear way of thinking: identifying patterns, asking the right questions, and staying calm when systems behave unexpectedly.

## Areas I’m Growing In

- **Vulnerability Research**  
  Identifying weaknesses in real-world environments, writing proofs of concept, and understanding the root cause behind each issue.

- **Malware Analysis**  
  Studying malicious behavior to better understand how attackers operate, and how to detect, contain, and respond effectively.

- **Incident Response and DFIR**  
  Investigating security events, reconstructing attack timelines, and writing clear reports that lead to real improvements.

- **Threat Hunting**  
  Proactively looking for signs of compromise in logs, traffic, and endpoint activity—before alerts are even triggered.

- **Security Engineering**  
  Thinking about secure design, hardening systems, reducing attack surface, and making life harder for adversaries.

## My Approach

I work on personal labs, break down problems step by step, and write about what I’m learning—honestly. I’m building a strong foundation to support a career in the area I'm passionate about.

I also value clarity in communication. Whether it's a technical report, a blog post, or a conversation with a teammate, I aim to explain what I see and why it matters.
